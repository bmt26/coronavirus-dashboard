Due to this unprecedented time is extremely important to know how countries and states are doing in regards to the number of deaths, confirmed cases, total deaths, and the people that have recovered from it.</p>
            <p>We also wanted people to be able to register on our website and add a home country if desired as well as compare countries by their statistics.</p>
