            &emsp;&emsp;We designed this website with the purpose to provide statistics on the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Due to this unprecedented time is extremely important to know how countries
            and states are doing in regards to the number of deaths, confirmed cases, total deaths,
            and the people that have recovered from it. We decided to work on this website and
            make it as useful as possible for whoever that visits our website by having a simple and
            user friendly UI.

            We also wanted people to be able to register on our website and add a home country if
            desired as well as compare countries by their statistics.
